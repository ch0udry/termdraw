# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Pinned OpenTUI runtime dependencies to exact versions so packaged and globally installed `termdraw` builds keep the bundled CLI and native runtime aligned.

## [0.3.3]

### Added

### Changed

- Renamed the Paint tool to Brush in the UI, added single-key tool hotkeys (`B` Brush, `A` Select, `U` Box, `P` Line, `T` Text), and made the Line tool render clean line glyphs automatically, including sub-cell Braille for shallow or steep angles.
- Split the published surface into dedicated `@termdraw/app`, `@termdraw/opentui`, and `@termdraw/pi` packages.
- Refreshed the README to better surface npm CLI usage, Pi usage, and package layout.

### Fixed

- Improved Pi embedding and save flow stability, including smoke coverage and relaxed host peer requirements.
- Improved line drawing behavior with shift-constrained lines, selectable stencils, and better angle matching.
- Added text border modes, explicit text entry activation, and curated brush presets.
